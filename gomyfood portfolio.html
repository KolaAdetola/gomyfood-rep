                    <div class="menu-item-description">White truffles are highly prized fungi with a distinctive aroma and delicate flavor. They have a rough, warty exterior and a marbled white interior. Found primarily in the Piedmont region of Italy, they grow underground in a symbiotic relationship with certain trees. White truffles are used sparingly in gourmet cuisine, shaved thinly over dishes like pasta, risotto, or scrambled eggs to impart their unique aroma and flavor. Due to their rarity and high demand, they are considered a luxury ingredient and are sold at premium prices.</div>
