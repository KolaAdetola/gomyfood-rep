                    <p>Mapo tofu is a classic Chinese dish known for its bold and spicy flavors. It features cubes of soft tofu cooked in a savory and spicy sauce made with fermented black beans, chili paste, and Sichuan peppercorns. Ground meat, typically pork or beef, is often added for extra richness and texture. The dish is renowned for its numbing heat from the Sichuan peppercorns, balanced by the creaminess of the tofu. It's a popular choice in both home kitchens and restaurants, cherished for its complexity and satisfying warmth.</p>
